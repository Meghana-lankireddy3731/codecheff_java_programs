//In ChefLand, human brain speed is measured in bits per second (bps). Chef has a threshold limit of XX bits per second above which his calculations are prone to errors. If Chef is currently working at YY bits per second, is he prone to errors?

//If Chef is prone to errors print YES, otherwise print NO.

//Input Format
//The only line of input contains two space separated integers XX and YY â€” the threshold limit and the rate at which Chef is currently working at.

//Output Format
//If Chef is prone to errors print YES, otherwise print NO.

//You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings yes, Yes, yEs, and YES will all be treated as identical).
